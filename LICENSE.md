# Copyright Information

This project is used under the [FreeType Project License](FTL.TXT).

The BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar to that of the X Window System. See the files [src/bdf/README](src/bdf/README) and [src/pcf/README](src/pcf/README) for more information. The same holds for the files [fthash.c](src/base/fthash.c) and [fthash.h](include/freetype/internal/fthash.h); their  code was  part of the BDF driver in earlier FreeType versions.

The gzip module uses the zlib license (see [zlib.h](src/gzip/zlib.h)).

The MD5 checksum support (only used for debugging in development builds) is in the public domain.
