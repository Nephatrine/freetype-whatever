This is my personal mirror of the FreeType project. It mostly contains changes
to the build system to bring it more in-line with other tools I use and
integrate more cleanly into my other projects and build pipeline.

I don't expect this to be useful to anyone else and suggest using the upstream
repository instead.

# FreeType

FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

It is written in C, designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable, and
portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images) of most
vector and bitmap font formats.
